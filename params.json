This works by finding patterns in the practice problems and using those patterns to generate a solution for the variables you have been given.\r\n\r\nTUTORIAL:\r\n\r\nSample problem: \r\nA motorbike traveling along a straight road increases its speed from v1 = 20m/s to v2 = 40m/s in 5 seconds. If the acceleration is constant, what is the distance traveled during this time?\r\n\r\nWe're also given the practice problem:\r\n\r\n     - A motorbike traveling along a straight road increases its speed from v1 = 30m/s to v2 = 50m/s in 6 seconds. If the acceleration is constant, what is the distance traveled during this time?\r\nThe answer to this problem (which is given to us by Webassign) is 240\r\n\r\nWe should reload the Webassign assignment to get a second practice problem:\r\n\r\n     - A motorbike traveling along a straight road increases its speed from v1 = 10m/s to v2 = 33m/s in 4 seconds. If the acceleration is constant, what is the distance traveled during this time?\r\nThe answer to this problem (which is given to us by Webassign) is 86\r\n\r\nSo, in each of these three versions of the same problem, we are given three variables:\r\n\r\n \t* The starting velocity. Let's call this variable A.\r\n \t* The ending velocity. Let's call this variable B.\r\n \t* The duration. Let's call this variable C.\r\n \t* The ANSWER. Let's call this variable \"answer\".\r\n\r\nIn practice problem 1:\r\n\r\n\tA = 30\r\n\tB = 50\r\n\tC = 6\r\n\tanswer = 240\r\n\r\nIn practice problem 2:\r\n\r\n\tA = 10\r\n\tB = 33\r\n\tC = 4\r\n\tanswer = 86\r\n\r\nWe should enter these 8 pieces of data into the Webassign Solver program. Then click \"Solve\"\r\n\r\nThe following output appears:\r\n\r\n\tConstant array: 40 \t\t\tScore: 100 (0%)\r\n\tAverage constant value: 1 \tA= 30   B= 50   C= 6\r\n\r\n\tConstant array: 12 \t\t\tScore: 29.75 (1.405%)\r\n\tAverage constant value: -4.82425539034587 \tA= 50   B= 6   C= 30\r\n\r\n\tConstant array: 32 \t\t\tScore: 11.4 (1.772%)\r\n\tAverage constant value: 7.9147724735703 \tA= 6   B= 30   C= 50\r\n\t...\r\n\r\nWe see we have a result with a score of 100. Nice!\r\n\r\nWe should then look in the constants box on the right to see which equation we should use. We get:\r\n\r\n\tConstant Array 40 = answer / ((B - A) * (C / 2) + A * C)\r\n\r\nVariables A, B, and C are from the actual problem:\r\n\tA = 20\r\n\tB = 40\r\n\tC = 5\r\n\r\n\"Constant Array 40\" is the \"Average constant value\", which is 1 (as you see from the output above). \r\n\r\nWe know have our equation to solve:\r\n\r\n\t1 = answer / ((40 - 20) * (5 / 2) +20 * 5)\r\n\r\nSolving:\r\n\r\n\t1 = answer / 150\r\n\tanswer = 150\r\n\r\nWe now have our answer: 150. You can use the Webassign Solver to solve any sort of math-based problem, as long as the problem lets you use practice problems.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
